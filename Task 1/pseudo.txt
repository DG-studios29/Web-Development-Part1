1. Vowels

Initialize vowel_Count to 0

Repeat
	request input from user
	store input into variable called "user_Input"

	if "user_Input" is a number 
		Exit the loop

	Otherwise if "user_Input" is a vowel
		increase vowel_Count by 1

Output total number of vowels entered (vowel_Count)


2. Integers

Initialize total_Sum to 0
Initialize even_Count to 0
Initialize odd_Count to 0

Repeat
    request input from user
    store input into variable called "user_Input"

    If the "user_Input" is not an integer number, ignore it and continue
    If the "user_Input" is zero, 
	Exit the loop

    Add the "user_Input" to total_Sum
    If the "user_Input" is even
        increase even_Count by 1
    Otherwise
        increase odd_Count by 1

	if even_Count is greater than zero
    		Set even_Average to total_Sum divided by even_Count

	else
   		Set even_Average to 0

	if odd_Count is greater than zero
   	 	Set odd_Average to total_Sum divided by odd_Count

	else
    		Set odd_Average to 0

Output (even_Average) and (odd_Average)


3. Alphabetical order

Initialize an empty list called "names".

Reapeat
	request input from user 
	store input into variable called "name"
	Add "name" to "names" 

	Sort the list "names" in alphabetical order.

	For each name in the sorted list

Output (name)
