 request input from the user 
 store it in a variable called "n".

 Initialize a boolean variable is_prime to true. 

 If "n" is less than 2, set is_prime to false.
	Output  (n) "is not a prime number."

 For each integer i between 2 and the square root of "n", 
 if "n" is divisible by i, set is_prime to false.
	Output (n) "is not a prime number."

 if is_prime is still true, 
	Output  (n) "is not a prime number."

 else, Output (n) "is not a prime number."
