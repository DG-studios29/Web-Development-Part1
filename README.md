Task 1: Thinking Like a Programmer - Pseudocode
This task introduces pseudocode, a way of planning your logic and structuring your thoughts before writing actual code. It emphasizes breaking down problems and writing steps in plain language to develop a solid approach to problem-solving.

Task 2: Your First Computer Program
In this task, you will create your very first program. You will write simple code that demonstrates fundamental concepts such as outputting text to the console.

Task 3: Variables - String, Numerical, and Boolean Data Types
Learn about different variable types: strings (text), numbers (integers, floats), and boolean values (true/false). These form the foundation of storing and manipulating data in any programming language.

Task 4: Beginner Control Structures - If, Else, and Else-If Statements
You will explore basic control flow with conditional statements, which allow you to run code based on certain conditions, such as if a value is true or false.

Task 5: Logical Programming - Operators
In this task, you will learn about logical operators (&&, ||, !) and comparison operators (==, >, <) that help make decisions in your programs.

Task 6: Capstone Project I - Variables and Control Structures
Apply your knowledge of variables and control structures to build a small project that demonstrates the use of these programming concepts.

Task 7: Beginner Control Structures - While and For Loops
Loops are essential for running code repeatedly. This task will cover the basics of while and for loops, two ways to iterate over data.

Task 8: Towards Defensive Programming I - Error Handling
Learn the basics of error handling, which allows you to anticipate and manage potential issues in your code, improving its robustness.

Task 9: Beginner Data Structures - Arrays and Maps
Explore data structures such as arrays (ordered lists) and maps (key-value pairs), which are used to store and organize data efficiently.

Task 10: Beginner Programming with Functions - Using Built-in and Defining Your Own
Functions allow you to organize your code and make it reusable. In this task, you will learn to use built-in functions and define your own to perform specific actions in your programs.

Task 11: Capstone Project II - Arrays, Functions, and String Handling
This project will challenge you to apply your knowledge of arrays, functions, and string manipulation in building a program that handles different types of data.

Task 12: HTML
Introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the foundational language for building web pages. You will learn to create the structure of a webpage using various HTML tags.

Task 13: CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML content. In this task, you will learn how to apply different styles, such as colors, layouts, and fonts, to your webpage.

Task 14: SCSS
SCSS (Sassy CSS) is an extension of CSS that allows you to write more efficient and organized stylesheets with variables, nesting, and mixins.

Task 15: Capstone Project III - Create a Web Page Using HTML and SCSS
Build a complete web page using HTML for structure and SCSS for styling. This project will combine your knowledge of web development and design.

Task 16: Programming in JavaScript I - DOM Manipulation
The DOM (Document Object Model) is how JavaScript interacts with web pages. This task introduces you to manipulating webpage elements dynamically using JavaScript.

Task 17: Programming in JavaScript II - Event Handling
Learn how to handle user interactions (such as clicks, inputs, and mouse movements) on your webpage by using JavaScript event handlers.

Task 18: Programming in JavaScript III - JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for exchanging data. In this task, you will learn how to work with JSON to send and receive data in web applications.

Task 19: Programming in JavaScript IV - jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies common tasks such as DOM manipulation and event handling. You will learn how to integrate jQuery into your projects.

Task 20: Capstone Project IV - JavaScript Fundamentals
This project will focus on building a dynamic webpage using JavaScript fundamentals like DOM manipulation, event handling, and JSON.

Task 21: The Command Line for Web Development
Learn how to use the command line to navigate the file system, manage files, and run commands for web development projects.

Task 22: Version Control I - Introduction to Version Control and Git
Version control allows you to track changes to your codebase. This task introduces Git, a powerful version control system that helps you manage project versions.

Task 23: Version Control II - Git Basics
In this task, you will learn essential Git commands to create repositories, track changes, and collaborate with others.

Task 24: Version Control III - Deployment of Static Websites
Learn how to deploy your static websites (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) using version control and hosting services like GitHub Pages.
